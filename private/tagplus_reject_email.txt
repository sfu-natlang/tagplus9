We are sorry to inform you that the following submission was not
selected by the Program Committee to appear in TAG+9 2008.

The selection process was more competitive this year than in previous
TAG+ workshops, and we had to choose a small number of submissions
to appear in the program. We hope you may still consider attending
the workshop.

The final list of accepted papers will be available on the TAG+9
web page:

http://tagplus9.cs.sfu.ca/

We have enclosed the reviewer comments for your perusal.

If you have any additional questions, please get in touch with us.

Best Regards,
Claire Gardent and Anoop Sarkar
TAG+9 2008
