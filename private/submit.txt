<h2><a name="guidelines">Guidelines for Formatting Papers for the Proceedings</a></h2>

<p>The deadline for submitting the final camera-ready paper for the
proceedings is <b>April 28, 2008</b>. You can submit your PDF file
by e-mail to <a
href="mailto:tagplus@sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de">tagplus@sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de</a>
or upload the PDF file to EasyChair (instructions will be emailed
to you).</p>

<p>The paper must be submitted in PDF format. The papers can be no
more than 8 pages in length, including all figures, references and
any other auxiliary information. There is no difference in the
length between a submission accepted as a talk compared to a poster
presentation.</p>

<p>It is very important to specify <b>A4 format</b> paper, and not to
include page numbers. For instance, create an A4 size output from
your .dvi file by running <code>dvips -t a4 dvifile</code> and
then convert to PDF using <code>ps2pdf</code>.</p>

<p>Authors are strongly recommended to use the style files provided
here. All manuscripts should look like the sample PDF file below,
which also contains the detailed formatting specification.</p>

<p>TAG+9 is using the COLING 2008 style files for formatting the
papers that will be published in the proceedings. However, please
do <b>not</b> contact anybody from COLING 2008 if you have questions
regarding formatting and use of these style guidelines.  If you
have any such questions, send them to <a
href="mailto:tagplus@sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de">tagplus@sfb441.uni-tuebingen.de</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="easychair">Help with EasyChair for Abstract Submission</a></h2>

<p>EasyChair really is easy to use. However, if you are running into problems, please refer
to the step by step procedure for submission given below:</p>

<p>The process breaks down into two stages: getting the account, and submitting the abstract.</p>

<p>Creating an account:
<ul>
<li>Go to the TAG+9 submission page</li>
<li>Click the "I have no account" button</li>
<li>Enter name, email, and secret word</li>
<li>Check your email</li>
<li>Click the link in the message you get from EasyChair</li>
<li>Enter your secret word</li>
<li>Enter all your personal info (* fields are required)
  <ul>
  <li>The password must be 8+ characters, or you get an error.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Click the button at the bottom to submit and go back to the login screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submitting your abstract:
<ul>
<li>Go to the TAG+9 login page</li>
<li>Enter your username and password</li>
<li>Log in</li>
<li>Click "New Submission" on the top of the page</li>
<li>Enter information about author(s)
<ul>
<li>For yourself, you can click the link at the top of the author box to enter your own information from your account profile into the form.</li>
<li>For others, type it in. There is a link to add information about co-authors but it is not essential to set this up. </li>
<li>Checkboxes select which author(s) will get emails from the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter Title</li>
<li>Enter Abstract (a short text blurb)
<ul>
<li>This is a text box that needs a short text blurb about your full abstract. Your full abstract has to be submitted as a PDF file which follows the guidelines described in the Call for Papers. This text box, in contrast, is a short text description of your work as required by EasyChair. Unfortunately, it is also called an abstract.</li>
<li>The abstract should be at least a few sentences long or EasyChair will not allow you to continue with the submission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter keywords (at least 2, up to 5)</li>
<li>Browse for the pdf file of your abstract
<ul>
<li>Checking "Abstract Only" implies that you are not uploading a file, and reviewers should only look at that text box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click submit</li>
<li>Logout is under a dropdown menu accessed by hovering your mouse over the EasyChair link.</li>
</ul>
