Detailed Explanation of the Review Form
=======================================

particular entry in the review form. If you have any concerns or

Review
------

Please supply detailed comments to back up your rankings.  These
comments will be forwarded to the authors of the paper. The comments
will help the committee decide the outcome of the paper, and will
help justify this decision for the authors. Moreover, if the paper
is accepted, the comments should guide the authors in making revisions
for a final manuscript. Hence, the more detailed you make your
comments, the more useful your review will be -- both for the
committee and for the authors.

Remarks for the Program Committee Chairs
----------------------------------------

You may wish to withhold some comments from the authors, and include
them solely for the committee's internal use.  For example, you may
want to express a very strong (negative) opinion on the paper, which
might offend the authors in some way. Or, perhaps, you wish to write
something which would expose your identity to the authors.  If you
wish to share comments of this nature with the committee, this is
the place to put them.

Overall Evaluation
------------------

Should the paper be accepted or rejected?

5 = Exciting: I'd fight to get it accepted.

4 = Worthy: I would like to see it accepted.

3 = Borderline: I'm ambivalent about this one.

2 = Mediocre: I'd rather not see it in the conference.

1 = Poor: I'd fight to have it rejected.

Reviewer confidence
-------------------

5 = Positive that my evaluation is correct. I read the paper very
carefully and am very familiar with related work.

4 = Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully,
and checked for uncited prior work. It's unlikely, though conceivable,
that I missed something that should affect my ratings.

3 = Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something.  Although
I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully
check the paper's details, e.g., math, linguistic data, experimental
design, novelty.

2 = Willing to defend evaluation, but it is fairly likely that I
missed some details, didn't understand some central points, or can't
be sure about the novelty of the work.

1 = Not my area, or paper is very hard to understand. My evaluation
is just an educated guess.

Appropriateness
---------------

Does the paper fit in TAG+9?

TAG+9 invites papers on all aspects of the TAG formalism including
relations to other grammar formalisms; please see the Call for
Papers for TAG+9.

5 = Appropriate for TAG+9. (most submissions)

4 = Linguistics or computer science but not typical TAG+9 material.

3 = Possibly relevant to the audience but not really TAG+9 material.

2 = Only marginally relevant.

1 = Inappropriate.

Clarity
-------

For the reasonably well-prepared reader, is it clear what was done
and why? Is the paper well-written and well-structured?  Does the
English or the mathematics need cleaning up? Would the explanation
benefit from more examples or pictures?

Is there sufficient detail for an expert to validate the work, e.g.,
by replicating experiments or filling in theoretical steps?

(Take into account whether any obscurity or minor English errors
could be fixed with relatively little effort, or whether the paper
requires more work than is likely to be carried out in the few weeks
available.)

5 = Admirably clear.

4 = Understandable by most readers.

3 = Mostly understandable to me with some effort.

2 = Important questions were hard to resolve even with effort.

1 = Much of the paper is confusing.

Correctness
-----------

First, is the general approach sound and well-chosen given the
purpose of the paper? Secondly, can one trust the claims of the
paper -- are they supported by proper linguistic analysis, experiments,
(other) empirical results, proofs, or other argumentation?

(Note that the kind of support required will be different for
different types of papers, theoretical or empirical, linguistic or
computational, fundamental or applied. Please try to assess whether
the justification offered is adequate given the goals of the paper.)

5 = The approach is very apt, and the claims are convincingly
supported.

4 = Generally solid work, though I have a few suggestions about how
to strengthen the approach or its justification.

3 = Fairly reasonable work. The approach is not bad, and at least
the main claims are probably correct, but I am not entirely ready
to accept them (based on the material in the paper).

2 = Troublesome. There are some ideas worth salvaging here, but the
work should really have been done or evaluated differently, or
justified better.

1 = Fatally flawed.

Meaningful Comparison
---------------------

Does the author make clear where the problems and methods sit with
respect to existing literature? Are the references adequate? Are
the new contributions meaningfully compared to the state of the art
in the area, e.g., in terms of experimental results, linguistic
coverage, or theoretical properties?

5 = Precise and complete comparison with related work. Good job
given the space constraints.

4 = Mostly solid bibliography and comparison, but I have some
suggestions.

3 = Bibliography and comparison are somewhat helpful, but it could
be hard for a reader to determine exactly how this work relates to
previous work.

2 = Only partial awareness and understanding of related work, or a
flawed comparison the state of the art.

1 = Little awareness of related work, or lacks necessary comparison.

Originality
-----------

How original is the approach? Does the paper break new ground in
topic, methodology, or content? How exciting and innovative is the
research it describes?

(Note that a paper can score high for originality even if the benefit
of the approach is not yet fully justified.)

5 = Surprising: Noteworthy new problem, theory, methodology, or
insight.

4 = Creative: Relatively few people in our community would have put
these ideas together.

3 = Somewhat conventional: A number of people could have come up
with this if they thought about it for a while.

2 = Rather boring: Obvious, or a minor modification on a familiar
theme.

1 = Significant portions have actually been done before or done
better.

Impact
------

How significant is the work described? If the ideas are novel, will
they also be useful or inspirational? If the claims and results are
sound, are they also important?

5 = Will affect the field by altering other people's choice of
research topics or basic approach.

4 = Some of the ideas or results will substantially help other
people's ongoing research.

3 = Interesting but not too influential. The work will be cited,
but mainly for comparison or as a source of minor contributions.

2 = Marginally interesting. May or may not be cited.

1 = Will have no impact on the field.
